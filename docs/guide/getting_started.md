## Getting Started

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is an open-source system for automating
deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

"Kubernetes as a Service" (Codename: Kubernikus) makes it easy to run Kubernetes clusters that are natively integrated with OpenStack. It is a managed service that takes care of installing, upgrading and operating the cluster.

It provides an easy entry to deploy containerized payloads and getting started
with Kubernetes without the operational overhead of setting up Kubernetes.
Due to the tight and convenient integration with OpenStack it becomes easy to
combine VM and cloud-native workloads.

### Key Features

  * Masters are managed centrally
  * Workload nodes are located in customer's projects
  * Combine VM and containerised payloads

### Enhanced Security

  * Air-Gapped masters and nodes
  * Full TLS encryption between all components
  * Unified authorization policy between OpenStack and [Kubernetes RBAC](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2017/04/rbac-support-in-kubernetes.html)
  * Authentication tooling
  * Auto-Updating nodes based on [CoreOS Container Linux](https://coreos.com/why/)
